Its been ten days of sobriety.

## Today's lesson:

An enormous expenditure of energy in negative speculations
is familiar to many of us; we remember the dark cast of mind that prevailed during the active stage of our own alcoholism. 

Some of it, to be sure, may have been simply a pharmacological effect of alcohol, which is a depressant drug. When we get the last molecules of alcohol out of the system, a lot of the gloom disappears along with it.

It may sting at first to bite the cynical comment from the tip of our tongue. We may have to swallow twice before
getting out a mildly positive remark of the type we called saccharine
during our drinking life. 

But it soon comes easier, and can become a
strong and comfortable force in our recovery. **Life was meant to be
enjoyed, and we mean to enjoy it.**

Many of us, when drinking, were deeply sure for years that our own
drinking was harmless. We were not necessarily smart-alecky about
it, but when we heard a clergyman, a psychiatrist, or an A.A. member
talk about alcoholism, we were quick to observe that our drinking was
different, that we did not need to do any of the things those people suggested. 

Or even if we could admit that we were having a bit of trouble
with our drinking, we were sure we could lick it on our own. Thus we
shut the door against new informat.

Staying sober can boil down to just such a choice, we have learned.
We can spend hours thinking of reasons that we want or need or intend
to take a drink. Or we can spend the same time listing reasons that
drinking is not good for us and abstaining is more healthful, and listing
things we can do instead of drinking.

## Todays reflection:

Every day is a day when we must carry the vision of God's will into all of our activities.

ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 85

How do I maintain my spiritual condition? For me it's quite simple: on a daily basis I ask my Higher Power to grant me the gift of sobriety for that day! I have talked to many alcoholics who have gone back to drinking and I always ask them: "Did you pray for sobriety the day you took your first drink?" Not one of them said yes. As I practice Step Ten and try to keep my house in order on a daily basis, I have the knowledge that if I ask for a daily reprieve, it will be granted.
