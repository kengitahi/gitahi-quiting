Its been nine days of sobriety.

Defiance is the outstanding characteristic of many an alcoholic. So it’s not strange that lots of us have had our day at defying God Himself. 

## Today's lesson:

Sometimes we defy because God has not delivered us the good things of life which we specified, as a greedy child makes an impossible list for Santa Claus.

I have always said, “Grant me my wishes” instead of “Thy will be done.”

At no time had I asked what God’s will was for me; instead, I had been telling Him what it ought to be.

This has to do with the quality of faith rather than its quantity.  I had wallowed in emotionalism and had mistaken it for true religious feeling.

Telling my story reminds me that I could go back to where I was if I forget how bad things became and the wonderful things that have been given to me, or forget that God is the guide who keeps me on this path.

Alcohol had become my everyday companion. At first, I considered it a friend; later, it became a heavy load I
couldn’t get rid of. 

It turned out to be much more powerful than I was, even if, for many years, I could
stay sober for short periods.

I kept telling myself that one way or another, I would get rid of alcohol. I was convinced I would find a way to stop drinking. I didn’t want to acknowledge that alcohol had become so important in my life. 

Indeed, alcohol was giving me
something I didn’t want to lose.

I found countless reasons to prove to myself that alcohol had nothing to do with my misfortunes. I told myself it was
because of fate, because everyone was against me, because things weren’t going well.

I must now think more about others than about myself.  One day I will have all these wonderful things—people who mean
more to me than anything in the world. I shall keep all that, and I won’t have to drink, if I remember one simple thing: to keep my hand in the hand of God.

## Todays reflection:

**This is not an overnight matter. It should continue for our lifetime.**

ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 84

During my early years in A.A. I saw Step Ten as a suggestion that I periodically look at my behavior and reactions. If there was something wrong, I should admit it; if an apology was necessary, I should give one. After a few years of sobriety I felt I should undertake a self-examination more frequently. 

Not until several more years of sobriety had elapsed did I realize the full meaning of Step Ten, and the word "continued." **"Continued" does not mean occasionally, or frequently. It means throughout each day.**
