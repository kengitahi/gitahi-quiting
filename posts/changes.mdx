Its been eleven days of sobriety.

“There’s only one thing you have to change, Kennedy, and that’s everything…”

## Today's lesson:

And if we are not kind to  ourselves right now, we certainly cannot rightfully expect respect or consideration from others.

We have found **we can enjoy, sober, every good thing we enjoyed 
while drinking—and many, many more**. It takes a little practice, but 
the rewards more than make up for the effort. To do so is not selfish, 
but self-protective. Unless we cherish our own recovery, we cannot 
survive to become unselfish, ethical, and socially responsible people.

## Todays reflection:

True humility and an open mind can lead us to faith, . . .

My alcoholic thinking led me to believe that I could control my drinking, but I couldn't. When I came to A.A., I realized that God was speaking to me through my group. 

My mind was open just enough to know that I needed His help. A real, honest acceptance of A.A. took more time, but with it came humility. I know how insane I was, and I am extremely grateful to have my sanity restored to me and to be a sober alcoholic. The new, sober me is a much better person than I ever could have been without A.A.
