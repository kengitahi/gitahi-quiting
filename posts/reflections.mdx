Its been eight days of sobriety.

I know I will lose my family and everything else if I let anyone, including me, get in the way of my sobriety.

## Today's lesson:

**They left me when I stopped drinking because I was no longer fun. Now I have left them because I am sober.**

I lay there and went back over and reviewed
my life. I thought of what liquor had done to me, the
opportunities that I had discarded, the abilities that
had been given me and how I had wasted them, and
I finally came to the conclusion that if I didn’t want
to quit, I certainly ought to want to, and that **_I was
willing to do anything in the world to stop drinking_**.

I admitted that from then on I was willing to
let God take over instead of me. Each day I would
try to find out what His will was and try to follow
that, **_rather than trying to get Him to always agree
that the things I thought up for myself were the things
best for me_**.

## Todays reflection:


Gossip barbed with our anger, a polite form of murder by character assassination, has its satisfactions for us, too. Here we are not trying to help those we criticize; we are trying to proclaim our own righteousness.

TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 67

Sometimes I don't realize that I gossiped about someone until the end of the day, when I take an inventory of the day's activities, and then, my gossiping appears like a blemish in my beautiful day. 

How could I have said something like that? 

Gossip shows its ugly head during a coffee break or lunch with business associates, or I may gossip during the evening, when I'm tired from the day's activities, and feel justified in bolstering my ego at the expense of someone else.

Character defects like gossip sneak into my life when I am not making a constant effort to work the Twelve Steps of recovery. I need to remind myself that my uniqueness is the blessing of my being, and that applies equally to everyone who crosses my path in life's journey. 

Today the only inventory I need to take is my own. I'll leave judgment of others to the Final Judge — Divine Providence.
