Its been thirteen days of sobriety.

For several years,  alcohol has had control over my life. 

“I used to hate myself in the morning due to the drinking. Now I sleep till noon.”  

That describes my past feelings totally.

**Today I choose to be happy, and when I’m not, I have the tools to put me back on track.**

## Today's lesson:

God was really taking care of me; I just didn’t know it at the time.

The truth is, most of my drinking was done at home alone. I would talk to people and do things, and the following mornings were awful, trying to piece together what I had said or done.

No longer do I have to drink, but it is much more than that. Everything I need is provided. I have a God of my understanding that helps me in every aspect of my life.

I am working the steps, my life is changing. I think differently today; I feel different today. I am new.

It’s as if I have a magic source in my life that has provided me with all I need.

I have been through hard times, but before A.A. it didn’t matter how good things got — I always had a feeling that something was wrong.

## Todays reflection:

Obviously, the dilemma of the wanderer from faith is that of profound confusion. He thinks himself lost to the comfort of any conviction at all. He cannot attain in even a small degree the assurance of the believer, the agnostic, or the atheist. He is the bewildered one.

The concept of God was one that I struggled with during my early years of sobriety. The images that came to me, conjured from my past, were heavy with fear, rejection and condemnation. 

Then I heard my friend Ed's image of a Higher Power: As a boy he had been allowed a litter of puppies, provided that he assume responsibility for their care. Each morning he would find the unavoidable "byproducts" of the puppies on the kitchen floor. 

Despite frustration, Ed said he couldn't get angry because "that's the nature of puppies." Ed felt that **God viewed our defects and shortcomings with a similar understanding and warmth.** I've often found solace from my personal confusion in Ed's calming concept of God.
