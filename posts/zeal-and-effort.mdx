Its been seven days of sobriety.

## Today's lesson:

If you still think you are strong

must have some help, we know that we (A.A) have an answer
for you.

You cannot fail, especially **_if you go about it with one half
the zeal you have been in the habit of showing when
you were getting another drink_**.

Slowly, but it worked!
