Its been firteen days of sobriety.

Simply stated, it is this: Above all other concerns, I must remember that I cannot drink. Not drinking is the first order of business for me, anywhere, any time, under any circumstances.

## Today's lesson:

When I view alcoholism as the life-or-death matter it is, the answer is plain. If I do not save my health—my life—then certainly I will have no family, no job, and no friends. 

If I value family, job, and friends, I must first save my own life in order to cherish all three.

During active alcoholism, I led a pretty disorganized life,
and the confusion often made me feel unsettled or even desperate.

Learning not to drink is facilitated, I am learning, by introducing some order into each day—but being realistic and keeping my plan flexible. 

The rhythm of my own special routine has a soothing
effect, and an apt principle around which to organize some orderliness is, “First Things First.”

## Todays reflection:

Finally, we begin to see that all people, including ourselves, are to some extent emotionally ill as well as frequently wrong, and then we approach true tolerance and see what real love for our fellows actually means.

TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 92

The thought occurred to me that all people are emotionally ill to some extent. How could we not be? Who among us is spiritually perfect? Who among us is physically perfect? How could any of us be emotionally perfect?

Therefore, what else are we to do but bear with one another and treat each other as we would be treated in similar circumstances? That is what love really is.
